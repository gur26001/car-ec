# car-ec

This project is made with html,css and js and jQuery. It is not made by react so don't run npm start

To see this project, open and click  "view raw", it will download "Final.rar"

after downloading open it, go to "Final" folder then open "home.html"(this the entry point to this project) and hence that one is my project , you can navigate through it

before clicking on search button , turn on local dummy json server for mock api to run to fetch the data. To do this:

Goto Final>CARS-API
Open your Git bash here and run :
1. <code>npm install -g json-server </code> , 
2.<code>json-server --watch db.json </code>


After above you are good to go to search in the search bar, lets say search "Audi" and click search button, you will see the list of car cards related to Audi brand.
Note(it doesn't contain all cars in the world, it has some dummy data of some cars for running this functionality)
